# bootstrap-dhall

## Motivation

I am still not smart and wanted to have a place where I can lookup how to use dhall.
[@redhood](https://github.com/red-hood) (who is actually smart) says that's what the cool kids use to do
[helmy stuff](https://github.com/helm/helm).

## Installation

* Install the dhall binaries - I honestly found the nix setup to be a pain and just used the dhall binaries from [here](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/releases/tag/1.40.2)
* Don't forget to load the submodule

## How to run

For running the example simply go:

```
make
```
